The model is demand-driven and incorporates empirically estimated behavioral equations, energy system dynamics via the FTT:Power framework, and detailed trade linkages across up to 163 countries and 120 regions.},

In total, six economic and seven energy equations are estimated across nine regions and 21 economic sectors, yielding over 2,000 estimated specifications. The estimations draw on global, sectoral datasets with the broadest feasible coverage using a fixed-effects panel econometric approach.},
