I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on labor economics and household behavior. My research areas include care work, aging, social norms, and gender and racial inequality. I am currently a Post Doctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Women's Policy Research](https://iwpr.org/) in Washington, DC.

My most recent work has been published as a [working paper](https://cfsrdrc.wisc.edu/project/jsit22-05) by the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently working on an impact evaluation study of clean cooking technology on time use and health outcomes with coauthors at the [World Bank Gender Innovation Lab](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/east-asia-and-pacific-gender-innovation-lab). I have held research affiliations with the [Social Security Administration Retirement & Disability Research Center](https://cfs.wisc.edu/) and the [Care Work and the Economy](https://research.american.edu/careworkeconomy/). I have a Ph.D. and M.A. in Economics from [American University](https://www.american.edu/) and a B.A. in Economics from [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/).

I will be available for a full-time economist role starting late spring of 2024. Please do not hesitate to contact me at bb3174a@american.edu.
