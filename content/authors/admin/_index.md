I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/). I am an applied microeconomist with a keen interest in applied econometrics and computational economics. My research interests include labor, demography, household behavior and gender roles. 

I am on the 2022/2023 Economics Job Market and will be available for interviews at the upcoming ASSA Meeting. 

You can find my [CV](https://binderiyabyambasuren.com/uploads/CV.pdf) and [Job Market Paper](https://binderiyabyambasuren.com/uploads/JMP.pdf).
