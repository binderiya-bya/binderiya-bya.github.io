I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/). I am a labor economist with a focus on household decision-making and gender inequality. I am also interested in applied game theory and computational economics.

I am on the 2022/2023 Economics Job Market and will be available for interviews in the upcoming ASSA Job Market. 

You can find my [CV](https://binderiyabyambasuren.com/uploads/CV.pdf) and [Job Market Paper](https://binderiyabyambasuren.com/uploads/JMP.pdf).
