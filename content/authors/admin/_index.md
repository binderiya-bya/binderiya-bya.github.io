I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on labor economics and household behavior. My research areas include care work, aging, social norms, and inequality of gender, race, and ethnicity. My most recent work has been published as a working paper by the [Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://cfsrdrc.wisc.edu/project/jsit22-05).

I am currently a Research Consultant at the [World Bank Gender Innovation Lab](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/east-asia-and-pacific-gender-innovation-lab). I have research affiliations with the [Social Security Administration Retirement & Disability Research Center](https://cfs.wisc.edu/) and the [Care Work and the Economy](https://research.american.edu/careworkeconomy/). I have a Ph.D. in Economics from [American University](https://www.american.edu/) and a B.A. in Economics from [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/). 

I am seeking a full-time job as an economist in the private industry and policy think tanks. Please do not hesitate to contact me at bb3174a@american.edu.
