## Working Papers  
  
#### {{< staticref "uploads/paper1.pdf" "newtab" >}}Long-Term Care and Informal Care Arrangements Between Siblings (Job Market Paper){{< /staticref >}}  
  
**Abstract**: This paper studies whether siblings risk-share when they are faced with long-term care demand from their aging parent. I find that the more children a single elderly individual has, the more likely they are to receive informal care and from multiple children. This is important as most studies examining the role of informal caregiving in the elderly individual’s long-term care arrangement ignores the dimension of multiple caregivers and the potential risk-sharing among siblings. Gender composition of children is also an important determinant of caregiving patterns of siblings, which suggests that son’s informal caregiving decision is highly responsive to whether he has a sister. Thus, policies such as providing compensation for informal caregivers may have heterogeneous effects on families based on number of children and the gender composition of children.

**Abstract**: The assumption that people are endowed with fixed, exogenous preferences governing their economic behaviors is at the center of neoclassical choice theory. However, various branches of literature have demonstrated that preferences are shaped by and respond to many factors such as institutional environment, social and cultural norms, family influences, and exposure to opportunities and past experiences1. Akerlof & Kranton (2015) proposes a theoretical model where individual’s behavior is shaped by social norms and self-identity and thereby endogenizing preference formation to explain differences in outcomes between social groups. Gender norm is an example of such social norms and plays an important role in explaining many economic behaviors between men and women. These behaviors can range from which career to choose, how much to work and earn, and how to allocate time between working in the market and caring for a young child at home. Individual’s beliefs about how they should behave or how others expect them to behave, which are shaped by social norms, dictate many of these economic behaviors.
