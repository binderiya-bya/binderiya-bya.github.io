I'm a consultant economist at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home). As part of [MINDSET](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6188978), I help build and estimate a global simulation model evaluating how climate shocks and mitigation policies affect macroeconomic and labor market outcomes across 163 countries. I am currently applying the model to analyze macroeconomic and climate impacts for Tajikistan's Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy 2050. 

My research areas include applied macroeconomics, inclusive growth, and labor and demography. I am especially interested in how structural transitions reshape labor markets and how the associated costs and benefits are distributed across workers. A paper on the gendered employment effects of climate mitigation in emerging economies is forthcoming in the [Journal of Economic Policy Reform](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/gpre20).
Prior to this, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the [Institute for Women's Policy Research](https://iwpr.org/) and a research consultant at the World Bank's [Gender Innovation Lab](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/east-asia-and-pacific-gender-innovation-lab). My previous work spans workplace flexibility, clean cooking technologies in Lao PDR, and family caregiving disparities. Earlier, I contributed to gender-aware CGE modeling with the [Care Work and the Economy](https://research.american.edu/careworkeconomy/) project at American University.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.A. in Economics from [American University](https://www.american.edu/) and a B.A. in Economics from [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/).
